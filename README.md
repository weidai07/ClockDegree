# Riddles of the Sphinx

#### _C#, .NET: Riddles of the Sphinx, 9/23/2019_

## Description
It's a console application where the Sphinx asks a riddle and the user must answer the riddle correctly.

## Application should have:

If the riddle is answered correctly, the Sphinx asks a second riddle and so on.

- Start with one riddle.
- If the user answers correctly, the Sphinx is defeated.
- If the user is incorrect, the Sphinx eats the user.
- Once the application is working with a single riddle, add a few more.
- Try writing a method to randomize which riddle the Sphinx asks.
